# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system uses Python, librosa, and a Random Forest Classifier to analyze audio from the RAVDESS dataset. It extracts features like MFCCs, chroma, and mel spectrograms to classify emotions. The trained model also organizes audio files based on the predicted emotions.
